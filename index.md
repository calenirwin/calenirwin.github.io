I build algorithms that help trains think for themselves.

Currently crafting the future of rail autonomy at Hitachi Rail in Toronto, where I spend my days teaching machines to navigate the complexities of transportation systems with the precision they deserve.

When I'm not debugging neural networks or diving into sensor fusion challenges, you'll find me:
- Lost in a good book (lately oscillating between sci-fi and philosophy)
- Wandering the trails of Southern Ontario with my camera
- Writing about the fascinating intersection of AI and everyday life
- Discovering new ways that technology can make us more human, not less

I believe the best solutions come from understanding both the elegance of mathematics and the messiness of the real world.

**Currently reading:** *Klara and the Sun* by Kazuo Ishiguro
**Currently building:** Predictive maintenance models that actually predict
**Currently wondering:** How we can make autonomous systems that people actually trust

*Always happy to chat about rail systems, machine learning, or that book you just finished.*
